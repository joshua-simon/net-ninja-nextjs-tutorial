**Routing in Next.js**

-We create page components inside page folder
-each page in next is driven by a react component. eg, for an about page, we'd have an about component.
-each page component has it's own file inside the pages folder

-the file name of each component is tied to the *route* for that particular page.
=> *file name is tied to route name*

-therefore, if you create a file pages/about.js, next will automatically create an /about route
to serve up the about component
    -the exception is index.js, for which next will create a '/' route.

-You can create *subfolders* inside the pages folder, that can contain page components.
    -eg, subfolder = *ninjas*, file inside = *test.js*
    -route would therefore be /ninjas/test
    -the route for ninjas/index.js would simply be /ninjas

**Adding other components**

In next, you can have "drop in" components like in regular react, ie, something like a navbar component.
    -we do not put these drop in components inside the pages folder
    -create new folder in root of project, place drop in components there

**Linking between pages**

-linking to page components by using link component. adds the ability to do client-side
navigation in the browser
    => different pages are loaded via *javascript*, and not new page requests to the server

-code splitting: only javascript for current page is served,
and only when we navigate to another page will the js for that page be served.

**CSS modules**

These are for page-specific styles. Allow us to write a stylesheet for each page component, 
can import that stylesheet into whatever component needs it.

Seletors need to be *class* selectors and not element selectors

**fetching data**

In normal react app, we fetch data using a hook like *useEffect*, which makes the request in the browser.
We don't however want to make requests form the browser in a next app, because the components are
all pre-rendered by the time they reach the browser. So we need to fetch the data before it's rendered.
=> To do this, we can use a special function provided by next: *getStaticProps*.
